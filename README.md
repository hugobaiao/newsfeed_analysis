# Tableau Project: User Engagement and Post Activity Analysis

## Introduction
This Tableau project provides a comprehensive analysis of user engagement and post activity on our platform. It offers insights into monthly post activity, user engagement metrics, post subtype distribution, and subtype popularity based on likes and comments.

## Contents

### 1. Monthly Post Activity and Average Likes
In March, there was a significant increase in post activity with about 17k posts, which is notably higher than most months (January-May), where the number of posts ranged from 5k to 8k. The range of likes typically fluctuates between 0.1 and 0.09, except for March, where it dropped to 0.04. This could indicate that while post volume increased, user engagement in terms of likes decreased.

### 2. Newsfeed User Engagement
The data shows that visits significantly outnumber likes and comments, with the active user count being approximately 10% of the total visits. This suggests that while users are visiting the platform, engagement in terms of likes, comments, and posts is lower. Efforts could be made to encourage more active participation from users.

### 3. Subtype Post Distribution
Level posts, course certificates, and collections are the top three subtypes in terms of post volume. Other subtypes are minimal, with streak and goal posts just surpassing the 1k mark. This indicates that users are more inclined to share their progress and achievements on the platform.

### 4. Subtype Popularity Measured in Likes
Course certificate posts receive the most likes, followed by goal and streak posts, which are very close together in 2nd and 3rd place but have less than half of the likes of the first place. Level posts also have a significant number of likes. The rest of the subtypes receive a relatively small number of likes, suggesting that they may not resonate as much with the user base.

### 5. Subtype Popularity Measured in Comments
"Text post" is the clear winner here with 102 comments, significantly more than any other subtype, none of which surpass 31 comments. This suggests that users are more likely to engage in discussion on text posts.

## Conclusions
These insights provide a valuable understanding of user engagement and content preferences on the platform. They can guide strategies to boost active participation and tailor content to user interests. Further conclusions will be added as more data is analyzed and new trends emerge.
